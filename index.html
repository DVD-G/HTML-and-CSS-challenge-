    <div class= "paragraph"><p id= "PARA"> One of my strengths is determination because even though something seems hard, I don't give up. I actually have the willpower to go<br>
                  on. Motivation for me has been fluctuating but it has not gotten to the point of actually affecting my dtermination and desire to keep<br>
                  moving forward. Determination is one of my strengths because I am able to power through assignments when I actually understand what I <br>
                  am supposed to do. I will keep going even if it means that I go to sleep at 1 in the morning. Most of the time I don't care what the circumstances<br>
                  are, I just know that I have to get my work done ASAP. What I try to do is fully focus on the assignments that are assigned to me in order to<br>
                  make them fast and of high quality.

    <div class= "paragraph2"><p id= "PARA2">Ovethinking is one of my great weaknesses because I tend to do it every single day. I always over analyze evry single that<br>
                                            comes my way. Along with overthinking, pessimism joins it to make a whole swirl of negative emotions. The problem with me <br>
                                            overthinking is that it turns me into a coward most of the time. Overthinking makes me lack the ability to take initiative<br>
                                            in dire situations. Most of the time I end just thinking about many different outcomes of a certain scenario and I don't <br>
                                            end up doing anything at all. I know that fixing this problem will be a struggle but with hard work, I will be able to <br>
                                            correct this negative behavior.
